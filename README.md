# Members Only

>This project is a Ruby on Rails project. The exercise is based on building an application where users can write posts and can only see which user wrote the post if the user is signed into the application.

# Getting Started
You should have Ruby & Ruby on Rails already installed on your machine before you begin.

To get a local copy of the repository please run the following commands on your terminal:

```
$ cd <folder>
```

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jacobrees/Members-Only.git
```

To install all of the ruby dependencies run the command `bundle install`

```
$ bundle install
```

To migrate the database run 'rake db:migrate' you will have to do this in order to do the next steps.

```
$ rake db:migrate
```

# Testing
To launch the rails server inside of your terminal you will need to navigate into the repository you have just cloned. You will do this by using `cd` inside of your terminal. Once you are inside of this folder run the command `rails server` and this start the webrick server. 

Below shows the following commands you will need to run to achieve this:

```
$ cd Members-Only
```

```
$ rails server
```

Next you will want to open up your browser and navigate to the root of the application inside of your browser `https://localhost:3000` from here you can play with and experience the application fully.
```
$ https://localhost:3000
```
